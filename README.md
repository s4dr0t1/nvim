# Neovim configuration

## How to setup the configuration properly

### Prerequisites

Some are optional but it's best to have them all.

- `git`
- `fd`
- `ripgrep`
- `make`
- `gcc` / `clang`
- `unzip`
- `curl`
- `wget`
- `python3` and `virtualenv`
- NodeJS LTS stuff, look into [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- `cargo`

### Installation

My configuration for Neovim has been setup with bootstrapping code powered by [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim). Works best with the latest version of Neovim.

```bash
$ brew install neovim 
$ cd ~/.config/
$ git clone https://github.com/s4dr0t1/nvim/
``````
